# About VanillaPlus

VanillaPlus is a Minecraft Multiplayer Server that tries to create a survival server with extra features using custom items through a resource pack and with the help of plugins.

The primary goal of the server is to showcase the features of the plugin [ItemsAdder](https://itemsadder.com){ target="_blank" rel="nofollow" } to show what powerful things one can create through its help.

The server was created and is maintained by [Andre601](https://andre601.ch){ target="_blank" rel="nofollow" } a Minecraft Plugin and Discord Bot developer. The infrastructure of the server is provided by [HumbleServers](https://humbleservers.com){ target="_blank" rel="nofollow" } and was kindly donated to Andre601 by LoneDev, developer of ItemsAdder and other unique plugins.
