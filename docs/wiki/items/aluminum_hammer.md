{{ infobox(

**Aluminum Hammer** is an Item used in crafting recipes for items such as [Crushed Ender Pearls](crushed_ender_pearl.md) or for converting blocks into their "cracked" variant.

## Usage

### Crafting

The Aliminum hammer is used in the Workbench for crafting recipes by placing it alongside other used ingredients in the crafting grid.  
For each item produced using the hammer, one durability will be used up.

### Interactions

The Aluminum hammer can be used on blocks by left-clicking them with it. This will cause the blocks to "crack", changing them.  
Only specific blocks are supported:

| Block                      | Converts to                        |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Amethyst                   | Budding Amethyst                   |
| Deepslate Bricks           | Cracked Deepslate Bricks           |
| Deepslate Tiles            | Cracked Deepslate Tiles            |
| Nether Bricks              | Cracked Nether Bricks              |
| Polished Blackstone Bricks | Cracked Polished Blackstone Bricks |
| Stone                      | Cobblestone                        |
| Stone Bricks               | Cracked Stone Bricks               |

Each successful conversion of a block consumes one durability from the Aluminum Hammer.
