**Teleport Crystal** is an item that allows you to save a location to later teleport back to.

## Usage

The Teleport Crystal is used by right-clicking with it. The first right-click will save the player's current location where the second right click will teleport them.  
The saving will only work if the player has at least 1 XP level available, while the teleport itself will both take 1 durability of the item and remove the previously saved location, allowing a new location to be saved.
